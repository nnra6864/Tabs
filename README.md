# Tabs
This submodule of NnUtils adds the much needed Tab system to Unity.<br/>
It's easy to use and expand on.<br/>

## Usage
This asset is not meant to be used on it's own, it depends on [NnUtils](https://github.com/nnra6864/NnUtils).
Therefore, I highly recommend just getting the entire [NnUtils](https://github.com/nnra6864/NnUtils) package([Instructions](https://github.com/nnra6864/NnUtils/blob/master/README.md#submodulerecommended)).
